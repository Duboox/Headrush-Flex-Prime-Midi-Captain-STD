Super Mode Function Configuration and Keyword Explanation for FW-SuperMD4.0 Version
(AI translated)

Press and hold the device's number 1 button or key0 botton, power on and connect the USB cable to the computer to enter USB setting mode. A corresponding MIDICAPTAIN drive will be simulated on the computer. After entering, you can find the corresponding configuration file in supersetup.

(1) Supports four trigger timings for buttons, namely short press down, short press up, long press, and long press up. The corresponding keywords are: short_dwX, short_upX, longX, long_upX, where X is a digit from 1 to 9, corresponding to the Xth press of keytimes.

    For example: short_dw1 = [1][PC][5][-] means sending a PC command at the moment of the first short press down, with a PC value of 5 and MIDI channel 1.

    Tip: When short press and long press need to be completely independent events, we can only define short press up and long press as the two timings, namely short_upX and longX. In this way, there will be no short press action output before long press activation.

(2) Each trigger timing can define a mixed control command, including MIDI PC command, CC command, NT (note) command, and mouse keyboard HID command, which can be a single command or a combination of multiple commands, with no limit on quantity.

    The format of each command consists of 4 square brackets[][][][], below are examples of 4 different types of single commands:

    [1][PC][8][-] means one PC command, sending PC8, MIDI channel 1
    [2][CC][10][127] means one CC command, sending CC10 with a value of 127, MIDI channel 2
    [1][NT][60][127] means one note command, sending note 60 with velocity 127, MIDI channel 1
    [send][HID][-][A] means one HID keyboard and mouse simulation command, simulating a quick press and release, with the key value A

    You can group every 4 [] together, and multiple sets of continuous groups can be arranged downwards for multiple command collections. For example, short_dw1 = [1][PC][8][-] [2][CC][10][127] [3][CC][20][127] [send][HID][-][A] ... Note the format, spaces are allowed but no line breaks are allowed in between.

(3) The keytimes keyword can define the multi-press loop of the button, and different control commands can be configured for each press.

    keytimes = [1] means this button is defined only for single press function
    keytimes = [5] means this button is defined for 5 times loop function, and you can configure 5 sets of different command parameters, with a maximum of 9 times.

(4) All configuration contents are in the supersetup directory, corresponding to the pageX.txt file. Each page is a control function set, and you can switch between page pages by long-pressing the rightmost button. There can be up to 99 pages.

    X in pageX.txt must start from 0 and can go up to 99, with continuous numbers in between.


(5) Then [PAGE] defines parameters related to each page

    page_name = [HXLP] Defines the name of the page, recommended 4 uppercase letters

    exp1_CH = [1] Expression pedal 1 MIDI channel
    exp1_CC = [1] Expression pedal 1 MIDI CC number

    exp2_CH = [1] Expression pedal 2 MIDI channel
    exp2_CC = [2] Expression pedal 2 MIDI CC number

    encoder_CC = [90] Encoder dial MIDI CC number
    encoder_NAME = [MYCC] Encoder dial function name

    midithrough = [on] MIDI passthrough switch on/off

    display_number_ABC = [abc3] PC display mode selection, 123 / abc3 / abc4 / abc5 / abc8 correspond to pure number or letter grouping, with intervals of 3,4,5,8

    group_number = [3] This is also to set the grouping method, when the above option is set to 123 numeric mode, here is a supplementary configuration for grouping intervals

    display_pc_offset = [1] Fill in 0 or 1, indicating whether the displayed PC value starts from 0 or 1, used to align with the display of different host devices

    display_bank_offset = [1] Fill in 0 or 1, indicating whether the starting group is from 0 or 1 in the case of grouping

(7) The specific configuration of the keys is [key0] [key1] [key2] [key3] [key4] [key5] ... According to the number of pins, the number of keys to be configured is also different

    Taking [key0] as an example:

    keytimes = [3] Configure the key as a 3-time loop key

    ledmode = [normal] Configure the LED light mode of the key as normal, which means the LED color value corresponding to the nth press is displayed

    ledmode can be one of normal / select / tap, where select means that only one key configured as select is lit up at the same time to indicate selection
    Tap is a flashing effect specially designed for beats. Note that the select configuration also has an implicit meaning. If a key configured as a multiple loop key has ledmode select, then when another key is pressed during the loop and returns, the loop status of the key will return to the initial state, that is, the function defined when pressed for the first time. On the contrary, if ledmode is normal, the previous loop will continue

    ledcolor1 = [0x666666][0x666666][0xff0000] Define the color value of the first press as (gray-white, gray-white, red), where 3 square brackets represent the color of the 3 segments of the light ring, the prefix 0x indicates hexadecimal number, and the RGB three components represent the red, green and blue color values,
    For example, 0xff0000 represents red component ff (256), green component 00, blue component 00, you can search online for the corresponding color values you want

    short_dw1 = [1][CC][69][0] Define a CC command to be sent on the first short press, channel 1, CC69, value 0

    ledcolor2 = [0xff0000][0x666666][0x666666] Define the color value of the second press as (red, gray-white, gray-white)
    short_dw2 = [1][CC][69][1] Define a CC command to be sent on the second short press, channel 1, CC69, value 1

    ledcolor3 = [0x666666][0xff0000][0x666666] Define the color value of the third press as (gray-white, red, gray-white)
    short_dw3 = [1][CC][69][2] Define a CC command to be sent on the third short press, channel 1, CC69, value 2

(8) Other predefined keywords and usage explanations

    Note the strict case sensitivity

    [1][PC][inc1][-] means PC current value +1, which can be inc1 / inc2 / inc3 / inc4 / inc5 corresponding to +1 +2 +3 +4 +5
    [1][PC][dec1][-] means PC current value -1, which can be dec1 / dec2 / dec3 / dec4 / dec5 corresponding to -1 -2 -3 -4 -5
    [2][PC][random][-] random means sending random PC value, MIDI channel 2
    [1][PC][auto][bank_inc] means PC automatic grouping, send group number +1

    The fourth bracket of the mouse keyboard simulation command can support the following keys:

    A-Z, 0-9, F1-F12, Mouse_L, (mouse left button press), Mouse_R (mouse right button press)

    Space, Esc, Caps, Right, Left, Up, Down, End, Del, PageUp, PageDown, Enter, Pause, Table, BackSpace, Home, Ins, PrintS (screen print)

(9) Functional tips

    After configuring the NT note command, after sending the note, the note may continue to sound, and a note command with a velocity value of 0 needs to be added to end the sound
    In many cases, you can also use the general [1][CC][123][0] mute CC command to turn off the sound, of course, this depends on whether the host supports it

    [press][HID][-][A] Using press to simulate key press, remember to configure the corresponding release command, otherwise the computer will continue to respond to the key press, which may cause the computer to crash and other problems

    [delay][HID][-][50] After sending the pure delay command, the device will not respond to any actions during the delay period, so please do not configure a delay that is too long

    The device remembers the current PC value and page every 30 seconds. At the moment of device memory storage, there may be a short response delay

    The current page jump can be controlled by external MIDI IN, and the corresponding command definition is CC 20 XX, where XX is the page number to jump to, Note that xx should be a value within the current page number range of the device
